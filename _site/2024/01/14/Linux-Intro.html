    <h2 id="what-is-linux">What is Linux</h2>

<p>The Three main types of operating systems today are Windows, Mac, and Linux. The thing that makes Linux special is that it is open source which means that it has no cost and it is very easy to change it. This has led to many people making their own flavors of Linux so you have plenty of options.</p>

<p>There are a lot of computers that run linux which might sound weird to you because maybe nobody you know uses linux. The reason for this is because a personal computer is just one type of computer.</p>

<p>Sure linux is not the most common when it comes to personal computers that you might own yourself. But it is the most common  when it comes to computers that companies buy to run servers or other types of machines.</p>

<h2 id="flavors-of-linux">Flavors of Linux</h2>

<p>There are potentially thousands of flavors of linux but i will only go into the most popular ones. You can think of it as different families because some flavors of linux are based on others or connected to others.<br />
The two biggest linux families are Debian and Fedora.</p>

<p>The Debian family includes: Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, and more.</p>

<p>The Fedora family includes: Fedora, Red Hat, and more.</p>

<p>Most beginners are recommended to get Ubuntu and I believe it is currently the most popular overall.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-get-linux">Should you get Linux</h2>

<p>I often hear people that are interested in tech or working in it that Linux is amazing and everyone should switch to it. That people are simply stupid for using windows or mac.</p>

<p>I do not agree with this, I think that although linux can be simpler than you might think there is still some barrier of entry. I think someone who has no interest in learning tech related things should not get linux.</p>

<p>If you are kinda nerdy and love looking things up and learning more about how your computer works and what you can do with it then you will love linux. I personally have started using linux but that is because I want to learn and tinker with it, not because it is objectively superior.</p>
