    <h2 id="classicold-javascript">Classic/old Javascript</h2>

<p>When javascript was first invented it was made to add interactivity to websites. It was intended to only be used on a website alongside HTML and CSS. At the time it was considered pretty easy to learn and you mostly handled events like button presses and form submissions.</p>

<p>A couple of years later it got a little bit more advanced because libraries started to appear. The most famous of which was jQuery. So now you have more to learn.</p>

<p>A couple of years after that Node was invented which let you use javascript outside browsers and on the server side. This became very popular and so now you had a whole new way to use javascript.</p>

<p>Since then there have been countless javascript libraries and frameworks. Not to mention that anyone can make their own node package which might become popular. You also now ‘had’ to learn react, typescript, node, vue, angular, tailwind, svelte, electron, eslint, webpack, babel.</p>

<p>Of course you don’t have to learn all of these, but my point is that the modern javascript landscape can be very overwhelming. I will give some more details on some of these frameworks and then what I recommend.</p>

<h2 id="node">Node</h2>

<p>Node is a way for you to write javascript outside of the browser. You can run a web-server or interact with a database and more. It is very common and popular.</p>

<p>You can also use the NPM(Node Package Manager) to easily install libraries and frameworks. You create a configuration file that says what libraries your project needs and then you can simply install them via commands.</p>

<h2 id="typescripteslint">Typescript/ESLint</h2>

<p>Javascript is a language that is not typed, meaning you don’t say what types a variable is when you define it. This is different from most other languages and makes javascript unique. Typescript changes this and adds typing to javascript.</p>

<p>The main reason you would want this is that it makes it a lot easier to spot any mistakes you have made. You will get a warning if a variable is trying to use a type it should not use.</p>

<p>When you use typescript you create typescript files(.ts) and then when you compile those files are used to generate normal javascript code. So typescript only does things for the developer, the user has no idea.</p>

<p>ESLint is somewhat similar in that it also just checks your code for possible errors and warns you about them. It is not specifically about types, but errors in general.</p>

<h2 id="react">React</h2>

<p>In my opinion, react is one of the most tricky things to learn but it is also one of the most popular. There are many things you can do with react, including client-side, server-side and mobile.</p>

<p>In react you structure your html code into “components” that you can then reuse. It is quite different from normal javascript but is very nice when you get used to it.</p>

<p>React has a lot of libraries connected to it that help you do other things. That is why there is so much to learn just within React.</p>

<p>There is also something called Vue which is very similar to React but is less popular so i won’t go into it.</p>

<h2 id="tailwind">Tailwind</h2>

<p>Tailwind is not strictly a javascript thing, it is more of a css thing. It completely changes the way you add css stylings to your html. The reason I mention it here is because it is something that a javascript developer might need to learn. It is also popular among those that use React/Typescript.</p>

<h2 id="babelwebpack">Babel/webpack</h2>

<p>Both babel and webpack are used to either compile or bundle a javascript project. It is more about configuration than programming. If you are programming small things by yourself you would never use these. It is more for big projects by big groups.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-you-learn">What should you learn?</h2>

<p>This depends on what your goal is of course. Since javascript is so broad and there are so many options, you need to know what you want.</p>

<p>If you want something simple and easy to learn then you should start with just normal vanilla javascript. You can use this to add interactivity to web pages and is already very useful.</p>

<p>If you want to make some server side stuff then you will need to learn node. This is also good if you want to start using other peoples code libraries since they are easy to install with NPM.</p>

<p>If you want to really be an expert in today’s javascript landscape then you will need to go into React and Typescript. I think all of the big teams and companies are using both of these. I also think if you want a job in the front-end it is likely this will be needed.</p>

<p>I think everything else can be nice to learn but should not be your primary focus.</p>
