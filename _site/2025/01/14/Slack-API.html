<p>I was doing a project with my raspberry pi and I wanted some way for it to alert me when something happened. I could have it send me a mail or a notification but I ended up having it send me a slack message. This was achieved easily by using the slack api.</p>

<p>For this to work you need a slack account and a Slack workspace. Then this will let you create a bot that sends a message to this slack workspace when you want it to.</p>

<h2 id="intro-1">Intro</h2>

<p>I found a <a href="https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/posting-messages-with-curl">tutorial</a> that is good and straightforward. You could just follow this and do well but here is a quick summary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to the link</li>
  <li>Click Create App</li>
  <li>Sign into slack if you are not already and pick a workspace</li>
  <li>Follow the step to create an app and generate a token.</li>
</ul>

<p>test if your token works by using curl(here you should use your own token) <strong>curl -d “token=xoxb-not-a-real-token-this-will-not-work” https://slack.com/api/auth.test</strong></p>

<p>Send a curl request: <strong>curl -d “text=Hi I am a bot that can post messages to any public channel.” -d “channel=C123456” -H “Authorization: Bearer xoxb-not-a-real-token-this-will-not-work” -X POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage</strong></p>

<p>On the last point you should change the channel to be the channel you want the message to be in. And again remember to use the token you generated and not “<strong>xoxb-not-a-real-token-this-will-not-work”.</strong></p>
