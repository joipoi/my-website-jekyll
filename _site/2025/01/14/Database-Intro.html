    <h2 id="what-is-a-database">What is a database</h2>

<p>If you have some kind of project where you need to store data, you have a couple of options. You could store that data in normal files in a format like json or xml. The other option you have is storing your data in a database.</p>

<p>I think when you are storing a small amount of simple data you don’t have any need for a database. But if you scale up and have more data with more structure, a database becomes a must. I will be focusing on the type of database called a “relational database”. There is another type of database but it is not as common.</p>

<h2 id="which-relational-database-to-use">Which relational database to use</h2>

<p>Even among relational databases there are a lot of options to choose from. However if you are new and want something simple the obvious answer is mysql. It is the most common and does the job well.</p>

<p>There is another database called mariadb which is very similar to mysql so much so that you could use that one and barely notice a difference if you are a beginner. Almost everything you learn about mysql will apply to mariadb too.</p>

<h2 id="downloading-your-database">Downloading your database</h2>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>For windows i recommend using mysql and not mariadb since it is a lot easier to download and start using. You can simply go to their website and download an installer which will guide you through it.</p>

<p>When you are using mysql you can decide if you want to just use the terminal to do everything or if you want a special program with a GUI that could make it easier if you are not used to using the terminal. If you want that you should also download the thing called mysql workbench.</p>

<p>If you do get the workbench I think it should be pretty easy to understand and use. If you are using the terminal you can read below where i show some commands.</p>

<h3 id="linuxdebian-based">Linux(Debian based)</h3>

<p>With linux you could get mysql or mariadb and it will be basically the same. I will go with mariadb for this example. On a debian based OS you would write this:<br />
<strong>sudo apt install mariadb-server</strong><br />
This should install and start everything, you can check it worked by writing:<br />
<strong>sudo systemctl status mariadb</strong></p>

<h2 id="terminal-commands">Terminal Commands</h2>

<p>To start doing things with your database you write<br />
<strong>mysql -u root -p</strong><br />
which will prompt you for your password and then you are in “database mode” where you can start writing other commands. Keep in mind you should end your commands with a semi-colon Here are some useful commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>show databases;</strong> - shows all databases you have</li>
  <li><strong>use &lt;database&gt;;</strong> - selects one database</li>
  <li><strong>show tables;</strong> - Shows all the tables of the selected database</li>
  <li><strong>describe &lt;table&gt;;</strong> - Shows the table structure of a table in the selected database.</li>
  <li><strong>select * from &lt;table&gt;;</strong> - shows all the data in a table</li>
  <li><strong>exit;</strong> - exits the “database mode”</li>
</ul>

<p>For any other commands you will be using SQL which I will not go into here but you can learn that on the internet.</p>
